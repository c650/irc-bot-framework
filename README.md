# An IRC Bot Framework

This framework is written entirely in C++. I wrote it because I felt like it.
Anyone is free to customize it, add to it, or even contribute in making a better, cleaner (please) framework.

All of this code is licensed under the MIT License.

# Building and Using

The code in [src/IRCBot](/src/IRCBot) is what is needed to use this framework.

I have added a few commands as an example, but they needn't stay if you don't want them to.
